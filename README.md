# One Twitter bot to *cohere* your team

Automated motivational tweets for your team.

### WTF?

A Twitter bot is, in lay(wo)man's terms, a computer program that tweets *automatically*. Following certain rules, the bot generates tweetable sentences and then pushes them to the Twitters via their [API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

This bot takes in the latest tweets from a list of accounts (your team, possibly) and then produces a sentence that starts with **We**, followed by a *verb* and some other words. For example:

* `We don't eliminate #poverty, #disease, and #automation`
* `We emerge from 11am!`
* `We improve the #Webâ€¦`
* `We encrypt finished citizen #neverTooLate`
* `We don't outsource through publication #ItSaysHere`
* `We survive on success #PostCapitalism`

### Get started

1. **Fork** this repository and *clone* it to your computer.
* Go to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com) and create a **new app**.
* Rename `RENAME_MEconfig.js`: call it `config.js`.
* Open `config.js` and change `YOUR_TWITTER_APP_CONSUMER_KEY` and all the other bits in capitals to your Twitter app's values (which you can find at `apps.twitter.com/app/YOUR_APP_ID/keys`)

	```js
	module.exports = 
	{
		keys:
		{
			consumer_key: 'YOUR_TWITTER_APP_CONSUMER_KEY',
			consumer_secret: 'YOUR_TWITTER_APP_CONSUMER_SECRET',
			access_token_key: 'YOUR_TWITTER_APP_TOKEN_KEY',
			access_token_secret: 'YOUR_TWITTER_APP_TOKEN_SECRET'
		}
		...
	}	
	```
* In `config.js` change the Twitter usernames inside `users` to the ones you want to grab tweets from, for the bot to build sentences upon. You can add as many as you like.
* Navigate to this folder in Terminal and then run `sudo npm install`.
* Test the bot by running `node bot.js`.
